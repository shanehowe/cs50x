                   Hey there, my name is Shane Howe and I am 24 years old. I am orignally from a place in Ireland called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Killarney,+Co.+Kerry,+Ireland/@52.0605348,-9.5426193,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48453c0cb4976ed9:0xa00c7a9973174c0!8m2!3d52.0599353!4d-9.5044265">Killarney</a> but now living in Vancouver, Canada. My hobbies include going to the gym, cooking and of course programming.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   I am a self-thought developer. I started to teach myself to code in 2021 where I wrote my first line of code "Print("Hello, World")". So as you might of guessed my first programming language was Python. Programming quickly became a passion of mine. I would go onto balancing a full-time job with learning to write code. I am extremely passionate about programming and look forward to my eventual career in the tech industry. I am always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Since learning Python I have moved on to learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, C and SQL. I gained a lot of the knowledge I have today through <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>. I have also gained quiet a lot of knowledge from Harvards online course called <a target="_blank" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/">CS50x</a>. I would highly recommend both of these recources for anyone who is looking to start their journey as a programmer.
